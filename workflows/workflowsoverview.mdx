## What Are Workflows?

Workflows in [Cal.com](http://Cal.com) allow you to automate actions when a specific event happens, such as when a booking is created, canceled, or about to start. This makes it easy to stay on top of communication, send reminders, and reduce manual work.

Each workflow follows a simple logic:\
**Trigger → Action**

- **Trigger**: When something happens (e.g., a new booking)
- **Action**: What should be done (e.g., send an email)

## Example Use Cases

- Send a reminder email and SMS to the attendee 1 hour before the meeting
- Send a post-event follow-up email with a feedback link
- Notify your internal teammate of the meeting details 
- Email the organizer if the attendee cancels
