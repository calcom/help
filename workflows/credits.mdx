- **Free Users**: No free credits. You can purchase credits in your [Billing Settings](https://app.cal.com/settings/billing).

### How Much Does It Cost to Send Messages?

- **US & Canada**: Free
- **Other Countries**: One credit = \$0.01 and we charge you based on Twilio’s costs per SMS plus an 80% processing fee ([Twilio SMS Pricing](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/sms/pricing/de))

### What Happens If You Run Out of Credits?

- We’ll send warning emails when you're low on credits. For teams, all admins will be notified.
- Once your account or team runs out of credits, SMS and WhatsApp messages will stop immediately. Messages will be sent via email instead.
