title: "HubSpot and Cal.com"
---

With our HubSpot integration you can sync data between Cal.com and your instance of HubSpot.

## Basic functionality
- On booking, we create a meeting record in HubSpot and associate it with the attendee's contact record
- On reschedule, we update the meeting record's dates and set the outcome to "Rescheduled"
- On cancellation, we update the meeting outcome to "Canceled"

## Event Type Options

#### Do not create new records for guests added to the booking
If this option is enabled, we will only handle creating meetings under the main attendee of the event and not additional guests.

#### Skip creating contacts if they do not exist in HubSpot
If this option is enabled, skip creating new contacts if they do not exist in HubSpot already. We search for contacts based on the attendee email.

#### Set booking organizer as contact owner
When this option is enabled, the booking organizer will be set as the HubSpot owner of the contact record. This requires the organizer's email to match a HubSpot user.

#### Overwrite existing contact owner
This option is available when [Set booking organizer as contact owner](#set-booking-organizer-as-contact-owner) is enabled. If this option is enabled, the contact owner will be overwritten even if the contact already has an owner. If disabled, the owner will only be set when the contact does not have an existing owner.

#### On booking, write to event object
When a booking is created, you can write to specific fields on the meeting record. To write to a field you need the following:
- The API field name ex. `custom_field`
- The field type in HubSpot. We currently support the following types:
    - Text
    - Date
    - Phone
    - Checkbox
    - Custom (ignores field validations)
- The value that you want to pass to the field ([Mapping data from Cal.com to HubSpot](#mapping-data-from-cal-com-to-hubspot))
    - For checkbox fields, you can choose whether to pass true or false


## Appendix

#### Mapping data from Cal.com to HubSpot
When writing to fields in HubSpot, you can pass data from different sources in Cal.com:
- To pass a static value, input the value in the `Value` field
- To pass a value from a booking question, wrap the identifier of the booking question in `{}` brackets. For example, if you have a booking question with the identifier `productInterest` you would input `{productInterest}` in the `Value` field
- To pass a `utm_parameter`, pass the parameter name as `{utm:parameter}` in the value field. We currently support the following:
    - `utm_source` as `{utm:source}`
    - `utm_medium` as `{utm:medium}`
    - `utm_campaign` as `{utm:campaign}`
    - `utm_term` as `{utm:term}`
    - `utm_content` as `{utm:content}`
