### 👋 Welcome!

Welcome aboard! This guide is for team members who have been invited to use [Cal.com](http://Cal.com) through their organization.

---

## ✅ Step 1: Accept Your Invitation

Look for an invite link in your inbox to join your organization's [Cal.com](http://Cal.com) workspace.

When you click the invite:

- Create a new account or log in to your existing [Cal.com](http://Cal.com) account
- Your profile will be automatically linked to your organization
<Note>You might also be invited to other teams within the organization, in which case, you can always visit [Teams](https://app.cal.com/teams) page and accept the invites.</Note>

> 🔐 If your organization uses SSO (Single Sign-On), simply log in with your work email.

## 📆 Step 2: Connect Your Calendar

Connect your work calendar to manage availability and prevent double bookings:

1. Go to [App Store → Calendars](https://app.cal.com/apps/categories/calendar)
2. Search for your your provider and authorize access
3. Select which calendars [Cal.com](http://Cal.com) should check for conflicts (toggle them on) and where to place booked events (Set as destination Calendar)

---

## 📅 Step 3: Set Up Your Booking Page

<Note>Please check with your organization admin if they have already assigned events to you.</Note>

Your booking link allows clients and teammates to schedule time with you. Here's how to configure it:

1. Go to [Event Types](https://cal.com/event-types)
2. Create or edit an event (e.g., "1:1 Coaching Session"). Note that any events assigned to you by your admin might be read-only and not editable by you.
3. Customize:
    - Duration (e.g., 30 minutes)
    - Location (Zoom, Google Meet, in-person, phone)
    - Availability (set working hours)
    - Buffer times and limits

> 🎨 Your company's default settings and branding may already be in place — you only need to personalize if desired.
>

## 🔗 Step 4: Share Your Booking Link

After setting up your event types, share your link through:

- Your email signature
- Inside Slack or Microsoft Teams
- On internal tools or client dashboards

Example: `https://cal.com/yourname/1-1-session`

For round-robin teams or routed events, your admin may provide a team-wide link that automatically assigns bookings.

---

## ✉️ Step 5: Set Up Reminders

[Cal.com]((https://app.cal.com/)) can automatically send:

- Email confirmations
- Reminders (Please check with your admin if they have already set up reminder workflows. In any case, you can create new workflows for your event types. You can create workflows by visiting the [workflows page](https://app.cal.com/workflows))
