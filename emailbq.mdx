title: "Require/Exclude Email Domains (Booking Question)"
description: "Description of your new file."

The **Email** field in Cal.com’s booking questions supports **domain-level restrictions**, allowing you to control who can (or can't) book time with you based on their email address.

### Use Case

This is useful when:

- You only want people from a specific company (e.g., `@company.com`) to book.
- You want to **exclude free/public domains** like `@gmail.com` or `@yahoo.com`.
- You're running internal meetings and only want your organization's members to access them.

If a user enters an email that doesn't meet your domain rules, they’ll see a message and won’t be able to continue until they provide an allowed address.
