title: Booking Success Redirect Parameters
description: Complete reference guide for query parameters forwarded to custom success pages after successful bookings
---


When a booking is successfully created in Cal.com, users can be redirected to a custom success page by enabling 'Redirect to a custom URL after a successful booking' option in the Event Type's Advanced settings page. 
This guide documents all the query parameters that are forwarded to your custom success URL when 'Forward parameters' option is enabled (which is the default).

## Overview

Cal.com automatically appends booking information as query parameters to your custom success redirect URL. These parameters allow you to display booking details, or integrate with your own systems.

**Example redirect URL:**
```
https://yoursite.com/booking-success?uid=abc123&title=30min%20Meeting&startTime=2024-01-15T14%3A00%3A00.000Z&attendeeName=John%20Doe&email=john%40example.com
```

### Common Issues

**Missing Parameters**

**URL Encoding Issues**
- Always use `decodeURIComponent()` in JavaScript or equivalent in other languages
- Special characters like `@`, `+`, spaces are URL encoded

**Date/Time Handling**
- `startTime` and `endTime` are always in UTC (ISO 8601 format)
- `hostStartTime` and `attendeeStartTime` include timezone information
- Convert to local time as needed for display

### Security Considerations

- Always validate and sanitize parameters before using in database queries
- Don't trust parameter values - validate against your expected data types
