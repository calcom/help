title: "Disabling Cancelling and Rescheduling"
---

[Cal.com](http://Cal.com) allows you to control whether events can be cancelled or rescheduled after they've been booked. These options apply to **both the organizer and the guest**.

#### **Disable Cancelling**

When this setting is enabled:

- Guests will no longer be able to cancel their booking via calendar invite links or email.
- Organizers will also lose the ability to cancel the event from within the [Cal.com](http://Cal.com) dashboard or via calendar/email links.

This is useful when bookings must remain fixed once confirmed â€” for example, in high-demand or tightly scheduled environments.

#### **Disable Rescheduling**

When this setting is enabled:

- Guests can no longer reschedule their booking using the links provided in their confirmation email or calendar event.
- Organizers are also prevented from rescheduling the event through the dashboard or calendar tools.

Enable this if you need to lock in meeting times and avoid last-minute changes.

<Note>
  These settings apply to the **entire event**, and affect both parties. Use with caution if flexibility is important for your scheduling flow.
