title: 'Allow rescheduling past events'
---

Enabling this option allows past events to be rescheduled, giving attendees the flexibility to book a new time if they missed the original event.

For example, if a meeting was scheduled but the attendee didnâ€™t show up, they can reschedule it instead of having to book a new event from scratch. This helps keep the booking flow smooth and reduces the need for manual follow-ups.
