The **Email** field in Cal.com’s booking questions supports **domain-level restrictions**, allowing you to control who can (or can't) book time with you based on their email address.

### Use Case

This is useful when:

- You only want people from a specific company (e.g., `@company.com`) to book.
- You want to **exclude free/public domains** like `@gmail.com` or `@yahoo.com`.
- You're running internal meetings and only want your organization's members to access them.

### How to Configure

Go to your Advanced settings of your Event type setup. Under **Booking questions, **find the Email field. Click on `Edit`next to the booking question, and you’ll see options to:

- Require emails that contain (...)
- Exclude emails that contain (...)

Simply use the fields to specify or exclude email domains for your specific use case.
