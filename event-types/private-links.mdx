title: Private Links
---


Private Links let you control access to your event types in a secure and flexible way. They are ideal for invite-only sessions, VIP access, pilot programs, or scenarios where you want to limit visibility and usage.

Unlike standard public links, **Private Links are not discoverable on your public booking page** — and can be configured with advanced **expiration rules**.

## Key Features

* **Multiple Private Links per Event Type**
  You can create several private links for the same event type — each with its own unique usage rules.

* **Usage-Based Expiry**
  Set a private link to automatically expire after it has been used a specific number of times.
  *Example: expires after 2 successful bookings.*

* **Date-Based Expiry**
  Set a specific expiry date after which the link will no longer be usable.
  *Example: valid until August 31, 2025.*

* **Non-Guessable, Secure URLs**
  Each private link is generated as a secure, hash-based URL that cannot be guessed or found publicly.

* **Granular Control via Event Type Settings**
  All private links are managed per event type under the **Advanced** tab of the event type settings.

## How to Use Private Links

1. **Open an Event Type**
   Go to the **Event Types** section in your dashboard and select the one you want to configure.

2. **Go to the Advanced Tab**
   Inside the event type settings, switch to the **Advanced** tab.

3. **Create a Private Link**

   * Toggle Private Link if it isn't already
   * Click **Add Private Link** to add more links
   * Click on the settings (gear) icon in front of the private link and define:

     * **Number of allowed uses**, or
     * **Expiry date**
     * Save the private link configuration
   * Save the event Type settings to be able to use the link

4. **Share the Link Securely**
   Copy and share the generated link only with the intended invitees.

## What to Expect

* If a private link has  usage limit, it will expire **after the set number of bookings are made using the link**.
* If a private link has date limit, it will expire **after the set date**.
* Once expired, the link will:

  * No longer be accessible
  * Show 404 error page if opened
* Private links **do not appear** on your main booking page or directory
* You can **delete** any private link at any time from the same event type settings
* You can **configure** any active private links from the same event type settings
