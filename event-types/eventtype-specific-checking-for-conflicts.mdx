title: "Event-Type Specific Checking for Conflicts"

By default, [Cal.com](http://Cal.com) checks for conflicts across all of a user’s connected calendars when determining availability. This ensures that if you already have something scheduled, no matter which event type or calendar it is tied to, you will not be double-booked.

However, sometimes you may want more control. That is where **Event-Type Specific Checking for Conflicts** comes in.

With this setting, you can define conflict-checking rules on a **per–event type** basis. Instead of relying on the global user-level conflict check, you can decide which specific calendars should or should not be taken into account for a particular event type.

### How It Works

- Go to your **Event Type Settings** → **Advanced Settings**.
- Locate the **Checking for Conflicts** option.
- Switch the drop-down from **User** to **Event Type**.
- Select the calendars you want this event type to check for conflicts.

This way, you can fine-tune availability logic for each event type individually. For example:

- For a **personal coffee chat** event, only check your personal calendar.
- For a **sales demo** event, only check your work calendar.
- For a **VIP event type**, check both but ignore shared team calendars.

### Why Use This?

Event-Type Specific Conflict Checking is helpful if:

- You want to keep personal and professional schedules separate.
- You are running multiple event types that do not need to block each other.
- You need flexibility for certain meetings that do not conflict with all your calendars.

In short, it gives you **granular control** over how availability is managed without being locked into a one-size-fits-all conflict rule.
