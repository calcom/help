title: "Event-Type Specific Checking for Conflicts"
---

By default, [Cal.com](http://Cal.com) checks for conflicts across all of a user’s connected calendars when determining availability. This ensures that if you already have something scheduled, no matter which event type or calendar it is tied to, you will not be double-booked.

However, sometimes you may want more control. That is where **Event-Type Specific Checking for Conflicts** comes in.

With this setting, you can define conflict-checking rules on a **per–event type** basis. Instead of relying on the global user-level conflict check, you can decide which specific calendars should or should not be taken into account for a particular event type.

### How It Works

- Go to your **Event Type Settings** → **Advanced Settings**.
- Locate the **Checking for Conflicts** option.
- Switch the drop-down from **User** to **Event Type**.
- Select the calendars you want this event type to check for conflicts.

This way, you can fine-tune availability logic for each event type individually. For example:

- For a **personal coffee chat** event, only check your personal calendar.
- For a **sales demo** event, only check your work calendar.
- For a **VIP event type**, check both but ignore shared team calendars.

### Why Use This?

Event-Type Specific Conflict Checking is helpful if:

- You want to keep personal and professional schedules separate.
- You are running multiple event types that do not need to block each other.
- You need flexibility for certain meetings that do not conflict with all your calendars.

In short, it gives you **granular control** over how availability is managed without being locked into a one-size-fits-all conflict rule.\

This feature is only available for individual event types, not team event types, because team events use the default calendar conflict logic of each assigned team member account.

<Note>
  **The event type specific checking for conflicts is only for your native calendar events. Cal.com events/booked slots are making you busy for the same slot across all of your individual events, regardless of the calendar you are adding this event to. That time is busy on your upcoming bookings page.**
