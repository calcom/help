This feature allows you to append virtually unlimited number of Cal.com users by simply adding their usernames with a **`+`** between adjoining usernames, and have a collective group. Try it now with Bailey and Peer, visit [cal.com/elon+zuck](http://cal.com/elon+zuck)

This is an opt-in feature where a cal.com user can enable/disable if they wish to participate in this and allow the bookers to add them as part of a dynamic collective group.
