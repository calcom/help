title: "Restriction Schedule"
---


Team members with elevated permissions (Admins and Owners) can now add **restriction schedules** to team event types (Collective and Round Robin). This feature acts as a **policy-based filter**—ensuring bookings can only happen during specific time windows, even if the user is available outside of that window. 

<Note>
This feature is currently available for teams on request. To enable it for your organization, please contact the Cal.com support team.

## How It Works

A **Restriction Schedule** filters availability by clipping off any time slots that fall *outside* the defined restriction window.

For example:
If your team’s availability is from **7 AM to 6 PM**, and your restriction schedule is set from **8 AM to 5 PM**, then:

* Slots from **7 AM to 8 AM** and **5 PM to 6 PM** will be removed
* Bookings can only happen between **8 AM and 5 PM**

This ensures more control over when your team can be booked—even if they're technically available outside the restricted window.



### Use Booker’s Timezone with Restriction Schedule

By default, the restriction schedule is applied in the timezone of the schedule you selected.
However, you can enable the **“Use Booker Timezone”** option to apply the restriction based on the **invitee’s** local timezone.

Example:
If you want to prevent bookings **before 8 AM local time for the booker**, enable this option and define the restriction as starting from 8 AM.
Now, a booker in New York won’t see slots before 8 AM *New York time*, even if the team is available at that hour in a different timezone.

<Note>
Restriction Schedules are an additional layer on top of your availability. If you're unavailable on a given day, Cal.com still won’t show any times—Restriction Schedules only further limit what's shown.

## How to Set It Up

1. Open the **Team Event Type**
2. Go to the **Availability** tab
3. Toggle **Add Restriction Schedule** to enable
4. Select the restriction schedule from the dropdown
5. Check the box to **Use Booker’s Timezone** (if desired)
6. Click **Save**


## Example: TCPA Compliance

If your legal team requires you to avoid contacting customers outside **8 AM to 9 PM** in their local time:

* Create a restriction schedule from **8:00 to 21:00**
* Enable **Use Booker Timezone**

This guarantees that Cal.com will only show time slots **within this window**, evaluated in the **booker’s** local timezone—ensuring TCPA compliance.


## Enforcing Company-Wide Booking Rules

Restriction Schedules also allow you to:

* Prevent early morning or late-night bookings (e.g., before 9 AM or after 5 PM)
* Block off **lunch hours globally** (e.g., 12–1 PM)
* Apply **blackout periods** for holidays or internal training sessions
* **Block entire days** using date overrides (the event type will be unbookable on these days for all members)
