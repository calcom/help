title: "Hide organizer's email"
---

This setting hides the organizer’s email address from guests—on the booking confirmation page, in email notifications, and on calendar invites. It’s useful when you don’t want the person booking to see or contact the organizer directly.

#### Useful when:

- You don’t want to expose a team member’s email to a third party.
- You’re adding the event to your business calendar but don’t want guests to see the personal email tied to your [Cal.com](http://Cal.com) account—especially if you originally signed up with your personal address (we’ve all been there).
- You want to centralize communication and avoid direct replies to individual inboxes.

#### How to enable:

- Go to the **Event Type** settings
- Click **Advanced Settings**
- Toggle **Hide organizer’s email**
- Hit **Save** in the top-right corner
