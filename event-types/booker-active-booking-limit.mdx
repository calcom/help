title: "Booker Active Booking Limit"

### Overview

The **Booker Active Booking Limit** lets you control how many active (upcoming) bookings a person can have at the same time for a specific event type.\
Once a booker reaches the limit, they won’t be able to schedule another event of this type until one of their existing bookings is either **completed** or **canceled**.

### Example

If you set the limit to **1**:

- The booker can only have **one active booking** at a time.
- Once that event is **over** or **canceled**, they can book again.

> Example:\
> If someone books a session and you’ve set the limit to 1, they can’t schedule another one until the current event is finished.

### Offer to reschedule existing booking

If a booker tries to book another time while they already have an active booking, you can choose to **offer them a reschedule** option instead of blocking the booking.

When enabled, this feature will:

- Detect that the booker already has an active booking.
- Prompt them to **reschedule their existing booking** to the new time slot they selected.

This helps avoid duplicate bookings while still letting them easily move their appointment.

### Why use it

- Limit repeat sessions to one at a time.
- Control the flow of upcoming meetings.

### Notes

- The limit applies **per event type**.
- **Canceled** and **past** events don’t count toward the limit.
- The setting affects the **booker**, not the host or team members.
- The limit resets automatically once the event passes or is canceled.
- The **reschedule option** only applies if the booker has an existing booking for the same event type.

### How to set it

1. Go to **Event Types** in your Cal.com dashboard.
2. Select the event type you want to edit.
3. Open the **Advanced** tab.
4. Go to Limits settings
5. Scroll to **Booker Active Booking Limit**.
6. Set the number of active bookings allowed.
7. (Optional) Enable **Offer to reschedule last active booking** if you want bookers to be able to move their existing booking.
