## Listening to Events

You can listen to an event that occurs in embedded cal link as follows. You can think of them as DOM events.

```js
<script>
  Cal("on", {
    action: "ANY_EVENT_NAME",
    callback: (e)=>{
      // `data` is properties for the event.
      // `type` is the name of the event(You can also call it type of the event.) This would be same as "ANY_EVENT_NAME" except when ANY_EVENT_NAME="*" which listens to all the events.
      // `namespace` tells you the Cal namespace for which the event is fired/
      const {data, type, namespace} = e.detail;
    }
  })
</script>
```

    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>`Cal.ns.yournamespace.on(...)`</td>
      <td>`Cal.ns.yournamespace('on', ...)`</td>
      <td>To be used when a namespace is used which you can identify by seeing if "init" call has namespace in it.<br/><br/>`Cal("init", "yournamespace", { origin: "https://cal.com" })`.<br/><br/>The Embed snippet you get from the Cal.com app uses a namespace derived from the event type slug.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`Cal.on(...)`</td>
      <td>`Cal('on', ...)`</td>
      <td>To be used when namespace is not used which you can identify by seeing if the "init" call has no namespace in it.<br/><br/>`Cal("init", { origin: "https://cal.com" })`</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
