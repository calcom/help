title: "Blocklist"
---

The **Blocklist** helps Organization Admins stop unwanted bookings made with suspicious emails or domains. Organization members can **report** bookings they believe are spam. Reported bookings are **flagged** and **auto-cancelled** (including all future occurrences for recurring events).\
Admins then review these reports at [/admin/privacy](https://app.cal.com/settings/admin/privacy) and decide to **Ignore** or **Block** the email/domain. Admins can also **add blocklist entries directly** without a prior report.

## What happens when a booking is reported

1. The booking is marked **Reported**.
2. The booking (and any **future recurrences**) is **automatically cancelled**.
3. The report appears in **Privacy & Security → Blocklist** for System Admin review.

<Note>
  Past occurrences in a recurring series are not retroactively cancelled.
</Note>

## Reviewing reports (Privacy & Security)

For each report the system admins see:

- **Booker email**
- **Who reported it** and **when**
- **Linked booking** (event, host, time)
- **Actions**: **Ignore** or **Block**

### Actions

- **Ignore**: Closes the report. The email/domain isn't added to the blocklist
- **Block** (Email or Domain):
  - **Email**: Blocks _that exact_ email.
  - **Domain**: Blocks _all_ addresses at that domain (e.g., `@example.com`).

<Note>
  When **blocked**, **any future booking attempts** are **silently rejected**. The booker is **not** told they’ve been blocked.
</Note>

## Add to Organization Blocklist

From the **Blocklist**:

1. Click **Add to Blocklist**.
2. Choose **Email** or **Domain**.
3. Provide the value and (optionally) a description explaining **reason/notes**.
4. Save.

This immediately activates the block for all users in your organization.

## How blocking works (under the hood)

- **Checks run at booking time** against global blocklist and your org’s blocklist.
- **Silent failure**: We do **not** reveal the block to suspected spammers (prevents evasion and harassment).
- **PII safe:** We do **not **reveal the host's PII in such cases.
- **Scope**: Org-wide. A blocked email/domain cannot book **any** user in your org.

---

## Benefits

- **Reduces noise** and protects calendars from spam or harassment.
- **Prevents recurring spam** by shutting down future attempts automatically.
- **Protects host privacy & safety** by avoiding explicit “you’re blocked” notices.
- **Saves time** for admins and hosts; fewer manual cancellations and follow-ups.
- **Organization-wide coverage** ensures consistent enforcement for all members.

## Best practices

- **Prefer domain blocks** for obvious throwaway/spam domains; use **email blocks** for one-off bad actors on otherwise legitimate domains.
- **Add a note** when blocking (reason, source). It helps future reviewers.
- **Review regularly**: Clear out resolved reports to keep the queue tidy.
- **Start narrow, widen later**: If unsure, block the email first; escalate to a domain block if you see a pattern.

---

## Permissions & access

- **Who can report**: Any user who receives a suspicious booking.
- **Who can review/block**: **System Admins** (and Owners).
- **Where**: `/admin/privacy` → **Blocklist** .

---

## Unblocking / managing entries

- Navigate to **Blocklist**.
- Find the entry → **Remove**.
- Removing an entry **re-enables** booking attempts from that email/domain.

<Note>
  Removing a block does not restore previously cancelled bookings; those must be recreated if needed.
</Note>

## FAQs

**Q: Will the booker know they were blocked?**\
**A:** No. We intentionally keep it silent to prevent abuse escalation and evasion.

**Q: Can I block subdomains only (e.g., `@mail.bad.com but not  @good.bad.com)?**\
**A:** Use a **domain** entry for the exact domain you want blocked. If you need finer control, prefer **email blocks** or add multiple domain entries.

**Q: Do past recurring instances get cancelled when reported?**\
**A:** We cancel the **reported instance and future occurrences**. Past instances are not retroactively altered.

**Q: Can I import a list of domains?**\
**A:** Add entries individually today. If you need bulk operations, contact support for recommended workflows.
