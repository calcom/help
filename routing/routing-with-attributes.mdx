title: 'Routing with Round Robin and Attribute Matching'
---
This guide walks you through how to set up a Round Robin Team Event that routes bookings to team members based on attributes using Cal.com's Routing Forms.

<Note>Attributes are only available in Organizations Plan and Enterprise Plan</Note>

## Setting Up a Round Robin Team Event

1. **Ensure a Team exists**
   If not already created, go to your organization and create a Team. For example, a team named `Sales` with the slug `sales`.
      ![Team](../images/routing/team.webp)

1. **Create a Round Robin Event Type**
   - Create this event under the team you just set up.
      ![Create Round Robin Event](../images/routing/new-round-robin.webp)
   - **Important**: Enable the setting `Add all team members, including future members`. This ensures team members are selected dynamically based on attributes.

## Creating an Attribute

Attributes let you define filters that team members can be matched against.

1. Go to [Organization Attributes](https://app.cal.com/settings/organizations/attributes)
2. Create one or more attributes.
   - For matching use cases, **Multi Select** is a great option—especially when team members might belong to multiple attribute values.
   - Example: Create an attribute with the name `Service (Attribute)` to clearly indicate it's used in attribute-based routing.

3. **Assign the attribute** to one or more team members. **This step is critical**.

## Setting Up a Routing Form

1. Navigate to [Routing Forms](https://app.cal.com/routing)
2. Create a new Routing Form **under the same team** as your event type.

3. Add fields that you want bookers to fill out.
   - It's recommended to include an `Email` field with the identifier `email` to enable integrations with CRMs and contact lookup tools.
   - Refer to [this guide](https://cal.com/help/apps-and-integrations/assign-people#option-2-based-on-emails) for more.
4. Create another field that matches the **options** from the attribute you set up.
   - The **name and identifier don't have to match** the attribute name.
   - Example: A `Service` field with identifier `service`, where the options are identical to those in `Service (Attribute)`.

## Connecting the RR Team Event, Attributes, and Routing Form

1. In your Routing Form, go to the **Routing** tab
2. Click `Add a new Route`
3. Link the Routing Form field to the corresponding Attribute
   - For example, connect the `Service (Attribute)` to the `Service` field in your Routing Form
   ![](../images/routing/routing-attributes.webp)

4. Click **Test Preview** on the left
   - Input a value that exists in both the Routing Form field and the Attribute
   - The system should now route the booking to a team member with that value assigned in their attributes

## Sending Leads or Visitors to the Router

There are two ways to use the Routing setup for collecting bookings:

### 1. Using the Cal.com Routing Form Public Page

- You can find the public link for your Routing Form in the UI
   ![](../images/routing/share-url.webp)
- The URL will look like:

```
app.cal.com/forms/{FORM_ID}
```

Share this link with your leads or embed it in your site.

### 2. Using Your Own Form with Headless Router (Embed Mode)

If you prefer to design your own form UI but still leverage Cal.com routing:

- Use the Headless Router endpoint:

```
/router?form={FORM_ID}&service=Service%20Type%201&email=jane@example.com
```

- The field identifiers become query params in the URL
- Cal.com will handle the routing and direct the user to the appropriate booking page

This gives you full control over your form UI while keeping Cal.com as the routing engine.

You’ve now set up a powerful attribute-based Round Robin routing system that integrates seamlessly with your team structure and forms.
