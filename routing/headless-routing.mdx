title: 'Headless Routing'
---
This guide explains how to integrate Cal.com Routing Forms with your existing forms and client applications, enabling seamless data forwarding and dynamic routing decisions.

---

## What is Headless Routing?

Headless Routing allows you to use your own custom forms (on your website, application, or landing pages) while leveraging Cal.com's powerful routing logic. Instead of requiring users to fill out a Cal.com Routing Form directly, you can:

1. Collect data through your own forms
2. Pass that data to Cal.com via URL parameters
3. Let Cal.com handle the routing decision-making
4. Direct users to the appropriate booking flow

This approach provides a **completely seamless user experience** while maintaining centralized routing control within Cal.com.

## How It Works

The headless routing flow follows these steps:

1. **User fills out your custom form** on your website or application
2. **Form data is collected** (e.g., name, email, company size, urgency)
3. **Data is forwarded to Cal.com** as URL parameters
4. **Cal.com Routing Form processes** the parameters
5. **User is directed** to the appropriate booking page or outcome(e.g. redirecting to an external webpage or showing a Custom Page with a message)

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create Your Routing Form

First, create a Routing Form in Cal.com with fields that will receive data from your external form:

1. Navigate to [Routing Forms](https://app.cal.com/routing)
2. Create a new Routing Form
3. Add fields that match the data you'll collect:
   - Use clear field identifiers (e.g., `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, `companySize`)
   - These identifiers will be used as URL parameter names
4. Configure routing logic based on these fields

### 2. Prepare Your External Form

Your external form should:
- Collect the necessary information
- Match field names to your Routing Form identifiers
- Construct the URL with parameters

### 3. Pass Data via URL Parameters

Construct the headless routing URL with your form data:

```
https://your-org.cal.com/router?form=YOUR_FORM_ID&firstName=John&lastName=Doe&email=john@example.com&companySize=10-100
```

**Important considerations:**
- URL encode special characters (e.g., `+` becomes `%2B`)
- All parameter names must match your Routing Form field identifiers
- The `form` parameter should be the your Routing Form ID that you see on in your Routing Form URL. e.g. for `https://app.cal.com/routing/route-builder/8cfd7889-9043-4e20-9a09-db8e2c9f747c`, the Routing Form ID is `8cfd7889-9043-4e20-9a09-db8e2c9f747c`

## Using Attributes for Team Member Routing

Headless routing works seamlessly with Cal.com's attribute-based routing system. This allows you to dynamically route bookings to specific team members based on attributes like:

- **Service type** (e.g., Sales, Support, Technical)
- **Language** preferences
- **Geographic region**
- **Product expertise**
- **Custom attributes** specific to your organization

### How Attribute Routing Works

1. **Set up attributes** in your organization settings
2. **Assign attributes** to team members
3. **Configure your Routing Form** to match fields with attributes
4. **Pass attribute values** via URL parameters from your custom form

For example, if you have a `service` attribute, you can pass it directly:

```
/router?form={FORM_ID}&service=Technical%20Support&email=user@example.com
```

Cal.com will automatically match this to team members who have the "Technical Support" attribute assigned.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Parameters not being recognized:**
- Verify field identifiers match exactly
- Check for typos in parameter names
- Ensure proper URL encoding

**Routing not working as expected:**
- Test the Routing Form directly first
- Verify all required fields are included
- Check routing logic configuration
