This guide outlines the process for an **organization admin** to elevate an existing member to an **admin** role.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Organization Members">
    First, go to your organization's members page. You can access this directly by navigating to `https://app.cal.com/settings/organizations/{org_slug}/members`, where `{org_slug}` is your organization's unique slug. You can do this by clicking on the Members tab in the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open User Options">
    Locate the user you wish to promote to admin. At the end of their row, click on the **three dots (...)** to open a dropdown menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit Member">
    From the dropdown menu, click on the **"Edit"** option. This will open a slide-over panel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Change Role">
    In the slide-over panel, click on **"Edit"** again. This will make the user's details editable. Click on the **"Role"** dropdown menu and select **"Admin"**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Changes">
    After selecting **"Admin"**, save the changes to promote the user. They will now have administrator privileges within the organization.
