title: 'Availability Dashboard - Overview'
---

Your availability dashboard is where you can create an availability schedule. Availability schedules are used to define the hours of operation that each bookable event type cross-references when offering appointment slots.  

There is no limit to the number of availability schedules Cal.com account holders can create.  

From within your availability dashboard is the place where you'll be able to create, delete, duplicate, and edit your account's availability schedules. This also includes team availability schedules if you're subscribed to a team, organization, or Enterprise plan.
