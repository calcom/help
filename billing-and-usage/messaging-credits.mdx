title: "Credit System"
---

At Cal.com, you can send SMS and WhatsApp messages, as well as use our AI-powered phone agent, cal.ai, to keep attendees informed about bookings, reminders, and cancellations. While these messages can be funded through various methods (e.g., organization-level billing), credits are one of the available ways to manage usage—especially for teams and smaller accounts.

## Overview of Credits

Credits are used **as a flexible payment method** to send:

- **SMS messages** (booking confirmations, reminders, updates)
- **WhatsApp messages** (booking alerts, confirmations)
- **Use **[**Cal.ai**](https://cal.com/ai)** **(AI-powered phone agent)

While many organization-level accounts may fund messaging centrally or directly via integrations like Twilio, **credits serve as a prepaid way to power messaging**, especially on smaller plans.

## Credit Allocation by Plan Type

The number of messaging credits available to your account depends on your plan type:

### **Organizations (Enterprise)**

- **1000 credits per team member per month**
- Messaging costs are typically covered through your organization's billing method
- SMS/Whatsapp sending is free

### **Team Plan**

- **750 credits per team member per month**
- Credits reset at the start of each billing cycle
- You can purchase more credits from **Team Settings** as needed

### **Free Users**

- **No free credits included**
- You can purchase credits manually from your **Billing Settings**

## Behavior When Credit Balance Is Exhausted

- **Low credit alerts**: We'll send email warnings when your balance gets low (all admins are notified for teams)
- **Exhaustion fallback**:
  - If credits run out, SMS/WhatsApp messages will **automatically stop**
  - Cal.com will **fall back to email delivery only** for affected messages

This ensures bookings still go through, but real-time alerts may be delayed if recipients rely on SMS/WhatsApp.

<Note>
  Credits are **not the only way** SMS/WhatsApp are funded — they're just the default mechanism for smaller accounts and teams

## Messaging Credits

### Credit-Based Messaging Costs

<Note>
  SMS/Whatsapp sending is free for Organizations
</Note>

The cost depends on the recipient's location and the delivery method:

#### 🇺🇸 United States & 🇨🇦 Canada

- **SMS and WhatsApp messages are free on the Teams Plan** in these regions
- Credits are **not deducted**

#### 🌍 Other Countries

- **One credit = \$0.01 USD**
- The total credit cost per message is based on:
  - Twilio's **region-specific SMS rates**
  - A standard **80% processing fee**

📌 _Example_:
If Twilio charges \$0.05 per SMS to India, your effective cost is:

```
0.05 + (0.05 * 0.8) = $0.09 = 9 credits
```

### Segment-Based Billing

Credits are charged **per segment**, not per message. Most SMS messages are broken into segments based on character count:

- **Standard segment**: up to **160 characters**
- **Messages with emojis or special characters**: up to **70 characters per segment**

Each segment is treated as a separate message, and credits are then calculated based on the information above.

## Cal.ai

Cal.ai pricing is based on credits, with each call consuming a set number of credits based on its length. The cost is 29 credits per minute, which equals \$0.29 per minute.
