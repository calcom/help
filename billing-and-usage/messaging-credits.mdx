title: "Credit System"

At Cal.com, SMS and WhatsApp messages can be sent to keep attendees informed about bookings, reminders, and cancellations. While these messages can be funded through various methods (e.g., organization-level billing), **credits are one of the available ways** to manage usage—especially for teams and smaller accounts.

---

## Overview of Messaging Credits

Credits are used **as a flexible payment method** to send:

- **SMS messages** (booking confirmations, reminders, updates)
- **WhatsApp messages** (booking alerts, confirmations)

While many organization-level accounts may fund messaging centrally or directly via integrations like Twilio, **credits serve as a prepaid way to power messaging**, especially on smaller plans.

## Credit Allocation by Plan Type

The number of messaging credits available to your account depends on your plan type:

### **Organizations (Enterprise)**

- **1000 credits per team member per month**
- Messaging costs are typically covered through your organization's billing method, making credits unnecessary
- SMS/Whatsapp sending is free

### **Team Plan**

- **750 credits per team member per month**
- Credits reset at the start of each billing cycle
- You can purchase more credits from **Team Settings** as needed

### **Free Users**

- **No free credits included**
- You can purchase credits manually from your **Billing Settings**

## Behavior When Credit Balance Is Exhausted

- **Low credit alerts**: We'll send email warnings when your balance gets low (all admins are notified for teams)
- **Exhaustion fallback**:
  - If credits run out, SMS/WhatsApp messages will **automatically stop**
  - Cal.com will **fall back to email delivery only** for affected messages

This ensures bookings still go through, but real-time alerts may be delayed if recipients rely on SMS/WhatsApp.

<Note>
  Credits are **not the only way** SMS/WhatsApp are funded — they're just the default mechanism for smaller accounts and teams

## Messaging Credits

### Credit-Based Messaging Costs

The cost depends on the recipient's location and the delivery method:

#### 🇺🇸 United States & 🇨🇦 Canada

- **SMS and WhatsApp messages are free on the Teams Plan** in these regions
- Credits are **not deducted**

#### 🌍 Other Countries

- **One credit = \$0.01 USD**
- The total credit cost per message is based on:
  - Twilio's **region-specific SMS rates**
  - A standard **80% processing fee**

📌 _Example_:
If Twilio charges \$0.05 per SMS to India, your effective cost is:

```
0.05 + (0.05 * 0.8) = $0.09 = 9 credits
```

You can check up-to-date Twilio pricing here: [Twilio SMS Pricing](https://www.twilio.com/sms/pricing)

### Segment-Based Billing

Credits are charged **per segment**, not per message. Most SMS messages are broken into segments based on character count:

- **Standard segment**: up to **160 characters**
- **Messages with emojis or special characters**: up to **70 characters per segment**

Each segment is treated as a separate message, and credits are then calculated based on the information above.

### Costs and plan limitations of cal.ai

**cal.ai** operates on a credit system, which is tied to the workflow credits used across the entire platform, including SMS and WhatsApp workflows. The credits allocated to your account are shared across these different communication channels.\
The number of credits included in your account depends on your plan:

- **Individual accounts**: No free credits are included. Credits must be purchased manually through your ‘Billing Settings’.
- **Team accounts**: 750 credits per team member per month. Credits reset at the start of each billing cycle.
- **Organization accounts**: 1000 credits per team member per month. Credits reset at the start of each billing cycle.

You can always purchase more credits through your ‘billing settings’.

\
Please note that the credits you receive are used for both cal.ai’s phone call-based scheduling actions and for any SMS/WhatsApp workflows you create. This means that when using cal.ai to make phone calls, those credits are consumed along with credits used for sending SMS or WhatsApp messages in workflows.

\
For more information on how credits are consumed and how to manage them, refer to the [Billing & Usage page](https://cal.com/help/billing-and-usage/messaging-credits).
