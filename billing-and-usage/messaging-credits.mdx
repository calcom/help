title: "Credit System"
---

At Cal.com, SMS and WhatsApp messages can be sent to keep attendees informed about bookings, reminders, and cancellations. While these messages can be funded through various methods (e.g., organization-level billing), **credits are one of the available ways** to manage usage—especially for teams and smaller accounts.

## Overview of Messaging Credits

Credits are used **as a flexible payment method** to send:

* **SMS messages** (booking confirmations, reminders, updates)
* **WhatsApp messages** (booking alerts, confirmations)

While many organization-level accounts may fund messaging centrally or directly via integrations like Twilio, **credits serve as a prepaid way to power messaging**, especially on smaller plans.

## Credit Allocation by Plan Type

The number of messaging credits available to your account depends on your plan type:

### **Organizations (Enterprise)**

* **Unlimited credits**
* Messaging costs are typically covered through your organization's billing method, making credits unnecessary

### **Team Plan**

* **750 credits per team member per month**
* Credits reset at the start of each billing cycle
* You can purchase more credits from **Team Settings** as needed

### **Free Users**

* **No free credits included**
* You can purchase credits manually from your **Billing Settings**

## Credit-Based Messaging Costs

The cost depends on the recipient's location and the delivery method:

### 🇺🇸 United States & 🇨🇦 Canada

* **SMS and WhatsApp messages are free on the Teams Plan** in these regions
* Credits are **not deducted**

### 🌍 Other Countries

* **One credit = \$0.01 USD**
* The total credit cost per message is based on:

  * Twilio's **region-specific SMS rates**
  * A standard **80% processing fee**

📌 *Example*:
If Twilio charges \$0.05 per SMS to India, your effective cost is:

```
0.05 + (0.05 * 0.8) = $0.09 = 9 credits
```

## Behavior When Credit Balance Is Exhausted

* **Low credit alerts**: We'll send email warnings when your balance gets low (all admins are notified for teams)
* **Exhaustion fallback**:

  * If credits run out, SMS/WhatsApp messages will **automatically stop**
  * Cal.com will **fall back to email delivery only** for affected messages

This ensures bookings still go through, but real-time alerts may be delayed if recipients rely on SMS/WhatsApp.

<Note> Credits are **not the only way** SMS/WhatsApp are funded — they're just the default mechanism for smaller accounts and teams </Note>
